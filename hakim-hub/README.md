## Features

### User Input Symptom

Users can input their symptoms using text-based input, allowing for a personalized recommendation search. The system asks for additional context or details to improve recommendation accuracy and requests confirmation before fetching recommendations.

### Recommendation Display

The system generates a list of recommendations for medical institutions and doctors based on the user's input. Each recommendation includes justification and relevance, sorted by relevance. Clickable buttons/links are provided to access detailed information on the entities.
