# HakimHub: Medical Information Recommendation System

## The Problem

Many individuals in Ethiopia face challenges when seeking medical assistance, such as finding suitable doctors and medical institutions based on their specific needs. The existing process lacks personalized recommendations and a user-friendly interface, leading to inefficiencies and difficulties in accessing quality healthcare services.

## Our Solution

HakimHub is a comprehensive medical information recommendation system designed to address the challenges faced by individuals in Ethiopia. Our platform allows users to input their symptoms and generates personalized recommendations for doctors and medical institutions. With a conversation-based interface, HakimHub understands user input and provides relevant recommendations conversationally.

## Features

### User Input Symptom

Users can input their symptoms using text-based input, allowing for a personalized recommendation search. The system asks for additional context or details to improve recommendation accuracy and requests confirmation before fetching recommendations.

### Recommendation Display

The system generates a list of recommendations for medical institutions and doctors based on the user's input. Each recommendation includes justification and relevance, sorted by relevance. Clickable buttons/links are provided to access detailed information on the entities.
